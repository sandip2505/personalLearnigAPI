<p>In providing our outsourced data protection officer ("DPO") services ("DPO Services") to clients ("DPO Clients"), we perform our duties accordance with the tasks detailed in GDPR Article 39. In accordance with GDPR Article 38(3), we do cannot receive any instruction from DPO Clients regarding the exercise of those tasks and therefore we perform the DPO role in an independent manner as a data controller.</p>

<p>In performing the DPO role, we obtain a range of personal data from the DPO Client relating to individuals connected to that DPO Client, such as shareholders, directors, employees, customers, patients, suppliers, or otherwise.</p>

<p>Please note that for our other services, such as our consultancy, representation, software or outsourced appointments, we act as a data processor on behalf of our client. Information about any such processing of personal data shall be contained in the data controller's privacy statement or policy.</p>

<h3 id="dpo-services-collection">3.1. How we collect your personal data</h3>
<p>Information about you, including your personal data, is gathered directly from the DPO Client pursuant to our performance of the DPO role and duties for that DPO Client.</p>

<h3 id="dpo-services-data">3.2. The personal data we use</h3>
<p>A lot of our DPO work is conducted using limited amounts of personal data. For example, we may process a DPO Client's employee's name and contact data for the purposes of interacting with that employee on a particular piece of work.</p>

<p>However, certain parts of the DPO work can involve viewing, reviewing and analysing all types of personal data held by a DPO Client in order to provide relevant guidance and direction to the DPO Client on how best to protect that personal data and protect the individuals' rights. Examples of where we may handle large amounts of personal data are in the event of assisting with reviews of specific processing activities or systems, or assisting with the management of data subject requests, cyber incidents, personal data breaches or complaints.</p>

<h3 id="dpo-services-purpose">3.3. The purpose and legal basis for processing your personal data</h3>
<p>We only process your personal data where it is lawful and necessary to do so, and only for the purpose of performing the DPO role for which we are appointed by the DPO Client and, once appointed, legally bound by GDPR Article 39. As such, your personal data are processed as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To enter into and perform a DPO Services agreement, including establishing the DPO Client's eligibility to enter in to the agreement and then performing the DPO Services (this may include the provision of services to assist the Forensics Client in complying with legal obligations such as family law obligation to have affidavits vouched or a court order for discovery);</li>
    <li>To enable us to comply with our legal, statutory and regulatory obligations including the performance of the DPO Services in accordance with GDPR Article 39; and</li>
    <li>To manage our everyday business needs in line with our legitimate interests, such as risk management, accounting, business continuity, complaint management, troubleshooting, technical support, protection of our assets and information, and to establish, exercise and safeguard our rights.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="dpo-services-sharing">3.4. Who we share your personal data with</h3>
<p>We only share your personal data with a third party where we have a necessity and have a valid legal basis to do so. Furthermore, we are legally bound by data protection law to perform the DPO tasks secrecy and confidentiality, and also are contractually bound to maintain confidentiality as per each DPO Services agreement with each DPO Client.</p>

<p>Accordingly, we only share your personal data with third parties in a limited set of circumstances, which may include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To the DPO Client as part of the performance of the DPO role for that DPO Client;</li>
    <li>To data protection regulators or supervisory authorities on behalf of the DPO Client;</li>
    <li>To third parties who are providing services to us to enable us to provide the DPO Services as per the agreement with our DPO Client and enable us to meet our legal obligations, including our software providers, IT support providers and consultancy support providers (note that where we enter into agreements with third parties to process your personal data on our behalf, we will ensure that appropriate contractual protections are in place to protect the security of the data);</li>
    <li>To statutory, regulatory, government or law enforcement bodies as required by law;</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="dpo-services-consequences">3.5. Consequences of not giving your data to us</h3>
<p>There is no obligation on you or on the DPO Client to provide personal data to us. However, we do need some personal data in order to perform the DPO Services for the DPO Client and failure to provide this information may result in us not being able to provide a certain element of the DPO Services where such personal data may be required.</p>

<h3 id="dpo-services-retention">3.6. How long we keep your personal data for</h3>
<p>Personal data is kept in a form, which permits data subject identification only for as long as is permitted while following fair and lawful processing.
